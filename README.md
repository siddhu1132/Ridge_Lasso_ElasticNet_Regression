# Ridge_Lasso_ElasticNet_Regression

Problem Statement: BigMart has collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Attributes of each product and store have been defined. 

Objective:
1. Build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store
2. Using Ridge and Lasso regression techniques, interpret the coefficients of the model
3. Make predictions using the model
4. Evaluate model efficiency using RMSE and R-Square values

Let's try and understand what could affect the target variable 'Sales'?

1. The time of the week - that is weekends as they are usually busy
2. Higher sales according to the time of the day that is, mornings and evenings
3. Higher sales during the end of the year
4. Items with more shelf space sell more.
